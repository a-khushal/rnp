# RNP (Rust Node Package Manager)

A fast, reliable package manager for Node.js, built with Rust. RNP provides npm-like functionality with improved performance and reliability.

## 🚀 Features

- `rnp init` — Initialize a `package.json` file
- `rnp init --yes` — Initialize with default values (no prompts)
- `rnp install <package>` — Simulated install of a package
- `rnp list` — List installed packages (coming soon)
- `~/.rnp/cache` — Automatic tarball caching for faster installs

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-khushal/rnp.git
cd rnp
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
./target/release/rnp init
./target/release/rnp init -y
./target/release/rnp install <package-name>
./target/release/rnp list
```

### Set up an alias (recommended)
To make `rnp` available anywhere in your terminal, add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`):

For Bash/Zsh:
```bash
alias rnp='$HOME/<pwd>/rnp/target/release/rnp'
```

For Fish:
```fish
alias rnp='$HOME/<pwd>/rnp/target/release/rnp'
```

Then reload your shell or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

After setting up the alias, you can use `rnp` directly:
```bash
rnp init
rnp install <package-name>
```
